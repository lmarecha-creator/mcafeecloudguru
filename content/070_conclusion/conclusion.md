We have:

- Deployed an application consisting of microservices
- Deployed the Kubernetes Dashboard
- Connect your CI/CD tool (Jenkins) to code repository hosting the CloudFormation templates.
- Used McAfee Mvision Cloud plugin for Jenkins to intercept security misconfigurations during the code build.
- Analyzed and fixed the misconfigured template reported and apply the according change in your code
- Validated the change by checking deployment of the services in AWS
