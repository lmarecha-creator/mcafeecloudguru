# Conclusion

## Congratulations!

McAfee and AWS thank you for investing time today to learn about how we can all work together to successfully improve security objectives in IaaS / PaaS / IaC! 

## Learning Summary 
In these labs we learned that adding MVISION Cloud to your AWS environment produced the following: 

- Identify and remediate configuration issues in AWS. 
    - This assures that misconfigurations, whether accidental or intentional, can be easily corrected to reduce risk when deploying resources into AWS. This is part of a "Cloud Security Posture Management" strategy used by many companies. 
- Use Data Loss Prevention policies to identify sensitive data stored in cloud services. 
    - By identifying sensitive data in S3 buckets, organizations can take proper steps to properly protect data stored in the cloud. These DLP policies can be extended to other cloud services such as Office 365, Salesforce.com, Workday, and other places. One policy, used everywhere. 
- Integrated security into CI/CD pipelines
    - We find customers care about this because adding security and configuration checks BEFORE code or infrastructure are deployed means that the security policies are applied earlier in the process. Developers and DevOps engineers can fix problems before they add risk to infrastructure and applications deployed in AWS. 
- Automate build checks and operationalize incident workflows
    - In the lab, the checks were made and reported into an incident workflow that helps customers account for issues. When issues are resolved, the incidents are marked as fixed; improving overall organizational efficiency. This workflow can go a long way to untangling complex AWS environments to reduce configuration and security incidents overall.
