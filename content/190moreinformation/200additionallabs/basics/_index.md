Fruit Smoothies wants to use Kubernetes as their compute platform. The development teams already use containers for application development and deployment, and using an orchestration platform will help them rapidly build, deliver, and scale their application.

To do this, you need to deploy the foundation of your Kubernetes environment.

In this exercise, you will:

- Create a new resource group.
- Configure cluster networking.
- Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster.
- Connect to the Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl.
- Create a Kubernetes namespace.
