Now that policies have been set and activated, it's time to kick off a manual scan. MVC supports both scheduled scans as well as Continuous Evaluation of configuration changes. For simplicity, we will be performing manual scans.

Hover over POLICY and choose ON-DEMAND SCAN.

Next to the "Security Configuration Audit Scan for Azure" click on the three dots (...) and choose START.

This can take a few minutes to run, so now is a good time to take a quick 2-3 minute break.
