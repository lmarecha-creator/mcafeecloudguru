Creating a Free Trial Azure Subscription

If you already have an Azure subscription, you can skip this section. Otherwise, follow these steps to create a free trial subscription. You will need to provide a valid credit card number forverification, but you will not be charged for Azure services.


Note: Trial subscriptions grant access only for a limited time. You may want to initiate your free trial when you are ready to begin your first lab assignment. The free trial is not available in all regions.


For more information, visit the Azure free trial FAQ page at https://aka.ms/edx-dat217-faq-az.

If you already have a Microsoft account that has not already been used to sign up for a free Microsoft Azure trial subscription, you’re ready to get started. If not, don’t worry—just create a new Microsoft account at https://signup.live.com.

After you’ve created a Microsoft account, browse to https://aka.ms/edx-dat217-az and click the Start now button. Then follow the instructions to sign up for a free trial subscription to Microsoft Azure. You’ll need to sign in with your Microsoft account if you’re not already signed in. Then you’ll need to:

- Enter your cellphone number and have Microsoft send you a text message to verify your
identity
- Enter the verification code sent to you
- Provide valid payment details—don’t worry, your credit card won’t be charged for any services you use during the trial period, and the account is automatically deactivated at the end of the trial period, unless you expressly request to keep it active
