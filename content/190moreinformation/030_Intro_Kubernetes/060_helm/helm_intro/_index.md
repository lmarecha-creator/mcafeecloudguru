## What to expect

MVISION Cloud will be connected to your provided Microsoft Azure account to monitor DevSecOps and Developer workflows. Use the provided credentials to log into both environments. 

The initial use-case is based upon managing cloud resources through Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM). As you deploy resources into Azure, McAfee MVISION Cloud will check configuration against best practices and standards. 

The next use case concerns itself with sensitive data stored in Micrsoft Azure. Customers often do not have visibility into what kind of data lives in clouds. In this case, an Bolb bucket is protected by MVISION Cloud 

Lastly, we will guide you through the "Shift Left" use-case. What if security principles were applied BEFORE a devops team pushed infrastructure? The scan results will show discrepancies that need to be remediated before being allowed to deploy to production. 

#### Labs Summary: 
+ Lab 1: Cloud Security Scans
     - A configuration issue will need to be resolved. 
     - A data compliance issue will need to be resolved. 
+ Lab 2:  CI/CD Developer Workflows - Protect insecure CloudFormation Templates
     - Learn about Micrsoft Devops
     - Connect MVISION Cloud to MS Devops
     - Correct identified issues in CloudFormation Templates (easy, medium, hard)
