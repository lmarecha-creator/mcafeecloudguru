# Shifting Security left With McAfee MVISION CLOUD

In a typical CI and CD flow, a code change triggers the build. Successful builds result in artifacts that are a deployable package. Ideally these packages should be ready to be deployed. But before they can be deployed, these packages must go through security review processes by a team commonly known as InfoSec. At times InfoSec reviews can be tedious and may delay the package to be deployed due to some potential vulnerabilities in the package, package lacks some of the organization security requirements or packages using unapproved third-party libraries.

Now in such cases many times security teams raise bugs and recommend fixes at the last gate and this delay the release despite following Agile and DevOps.

A newly coined term DevSecOps advocates these security validation processes to shift left in the application life cycle.
