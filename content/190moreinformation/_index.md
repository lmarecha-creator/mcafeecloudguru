# Workshop Welcome

Thank you for attending this workshop! Here is a brief introduction of the lab objectives and what we hope you learn today.

### What to expect ###

1. The initial use-case is based upon managing cloud resources through Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM). As you deploy resources like AKS into Azure,
   McAfee MVISION Cloud will check configuration against best practices and standards. .

2. MVISION Cloud Container Vulnerability Scan (CVS) assesses the vulnerability of container components. The scan evaluates the code embedded in containers at build    time, and periodically after that, to make sure that known risks are exposed or mitigated to reduce the opportunities malicious actors have to exfiltrate a          container workload.
3. The next use case concerns itself with sensitive data stored in Micrsoft Azure. Customers often do not have visibility into what kind of data lives in clouds. 
   In this case, an Blob storage is protected by MVISION Cloud 

4. Lastly, we will guide you through the "Shift Left" use-case. What if security principles were applied BEFORE a devops team pushed infrastructure? 
   The scan results will show discrepancies that need to be remediated before being allowed to deploy to production.
