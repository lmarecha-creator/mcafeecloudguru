```
   kubectl get deployments
```
```

   frontend       1/1     1            1           106m
   redis-master   1/1     1            1           2d4h
   redis-slave    2/2     2            2           2d4h
```
2. Scale out the frontend web services from 1 to 10:

```
   kubectl scale deployment frontend --replicas=10
```

3. Check the deployments after the change to see the number of frontend web services available and ready:
```
