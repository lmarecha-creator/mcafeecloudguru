One of the most important resources you will be using is the Cloud 9, cloud based, Integrated Developer Environment (IDE). This is similar to using Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA as an IDE. However Cloud 9 runs in the cloud, on a EC2 machine and can be accessed through the web browser.
No installation is needed and when working with it, you are already in the correct network and using the correct AWS credentials needed for our workshop.

If you want to learn more about Cloud 9 and how it works you can visit the [official Getting Started with Cloud 9 pages](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/product?ad=c&cp=bn&p=c9#) for further information
