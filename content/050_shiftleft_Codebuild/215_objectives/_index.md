1. **Set up CodeBuild & CodeCommit** - We'll start off by learning and setting up CodeBuild and CodeCommit from cloudformation template

2. **Set Infrastructure Security Policy** - Then we will configure a few policies in MVISION Cloud to control what kind of security or best practices must be present in infrastructure deployed to AWS.

4. **Put your developer hat on** - Now comes the fun part!  You'll run into trouble trying to deploy insecure infrastructure-as-code (CloudFormation) templates.  Test your skills to see if you can solve the problems at three different levels!

#### Let's get started with the lab in the next section!
