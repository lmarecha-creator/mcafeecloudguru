In this section, we will locate and connect to a basic installation of Jenkins which as been preinstalled in your AWS lab environment.

## Find your Jenkins instance

When logged in to your AWS account, navigate to EC2 in the US-WEST-2 (Oregon) region:

![CF](/images/mfe/CF.png?classes=border,shadow)
You will find two EC2 t2.micro instances created in this region.  One will have a name that refers to Cloud9 (Amazon's web-based Integrated Development Environmen) and one other without a name.  The one without a name is your Jenkins instance, which you can verify by the name of the security group (which will refer to Jenkins).

**Locate and record the public IP address for you Jenkins instance (it will be different from the IP address below):**

![Jenkins' IP Address](/images/mfe/findjenkins2.png?classes=border,shadow)

## Connect to Jenkins
